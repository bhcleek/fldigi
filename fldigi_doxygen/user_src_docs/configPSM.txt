\section sConfigPSM PSM Configuration

The Power Signal Monitor (<b>PSM</b>) configuration panel consist of four
different sections. Each with specific functions to enhance the detections
of signals with the intent of minimizing collisions.
<br>

\par NOTE:
In the event of a transmit with PSM enabled, the T/R button light will
indicate yellow when a pending transmission is in play. Deselecting a second
time (while yellow or red) will terminate the transmission.

\subsection ssBusyChannel Busy Channel

<br>
\image html config-psm-busy.png "Busy Channel"
\image latex config-psm-busy.png "Busy Channel" width=5.5in
<br>

To enable Busy channel select "[x] Enable Busy Channel" checkbox option
provided on the left hand side of the configuration panel.

There are a number of control parameters for adjusting to the current
conditions.

<b>Allow TX After Signal Detection (Seconds)</b>
<br>

Places a TX inhibit any time there is a signal present on the waterfall. When
a signal is detected the inhibit timer is reset to the selected value and will
remain inhibited for the specified duration (minimum, in seconds). This can be
useful during signal fades allowing for a period of time elapse to ensure the
signal has completed. Generally it's a good idea to turn this option on when
there is fair amount of QSB. This also can be used to prevent FLDIGI from
transmitting in between the gaps of RSID and the data stream.

<b>TX Buffer Flush Timer (Minutes, 0=Disable)</b>
<br>

If there is an extended period of time when FLDIGI has not been allowed to
transmit. The transmit buffer is cleared to prevent an excessively
long transmit period once the frequency clears. This is generally not an issue
with keyboard ops, but with programs using one of the three IO ports
(ARQ/KISS/XMLRPC). It's possible large sums of data might be present in the
transmit buffer. <br>

Setting this value to 0 (zero) disables the TX buffer flushing.
<br>

<b>Modem Bandwidth Margins</b>
<br>

The method used to detect a signal is the difference between high and low
values within in bandwith of the modem in addition to the bandwidth margins.
If a modem is selected (like MT63) there is very little difference in the
high/low values within the bandwidth of this modem. By extending the sampling
to just outside of the modem bandwidth high/low values are typically present.
However, the draw back to extending the bandwidth margins is nearby signals
will effectively keep FLDIGI from transmitting until both the margin and
modem bandwidths are clear.
<br>

<b>Valid Signal Sample Period (Milliseconds)</b>
<br>

As a general rule, the shorter the sampling period the better. The actual
sample rate has as much to do the the Waterfall display rate. PSM is event
driven by the waterfall update routines. Ensure the Waterfall display rate
is set to "FAST" for best results. <br>

\subsection ssCSMA Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)

Carrier Sense Multiple Access <b>CSMA</b> adds a little randomness to the
transmit process. By varying the transmitting actions of FLDIDI by random
amounts synchronized transit collision can be reduced. <br>

\image html config-psm-csma.png "CSMA"

<br>

To enable CSMA select "[x] Enable CSMA" checkbox option
provided on the left hand side of the configuration panel.

<b>Persistance</b>
<br>

Persistance is the random part of the process. A random number is generated and
compared to the persistance value. If the persistance value is lower then the
generated number tranmission is allowed. The second field in the Persistance
row (config panel) indicates the percent chance of transmitting each time a
random number is generated and compared. The accumulative delay in the
transmit period is governed by the slot time.
<br>

<b>Slot Time</b>
<br>

Slot time is the minimum amount of time between data transmissions of open air
time. No transmissions are allowed during this break. This variable effects
the delay period as governed by the persistance parameter. The persistence
value prevents the transmission and is delayed by the slot time value before
the persistance value can be evaluated again during the random number
generator and compare process.
<br>

<b>Transmit Data Delay</b>
<br>

If the modem being used has the option to idle transmit. This is the duration
in milliseconds the transmissions send idle data. Useful for repeaters or other
conditions that have a delay before decoding can occur.
<br>

\subsection ssPSMHistro Histogram

<br>
\image html config-psm-histo.png "Histogram"
\image latex config-psm-histo.png "Histogram" width=5.5in
<br>

This option is experimental. The basic idea is to keep the PSM threshold
a few points just above the noise level. If the noise level changes so does
the histogram reference. It's intended to be used with FM modulations.
This option is not suitable with Busy channel.
<br>

\subsection ssPSMPSMAtten PSM Attenuation (Sensitivity Adjustment)

<br>
\image html config-psm-atten.png "PSM Attenuation"
\image latex config-psm-atten.png "PSM Attenuation" width=5.5in
<br>

Generally you would want to keep the value around 2 to 4 for over the air
use. If you are testing using a direct connect (soundcard to soundcard)
you will need to increase the attenuations up considerably. The representation
of the value is simply a 1 over N fraction. If the attenuation value is set to
2 then the attenuation is 1/2 of the full signal level.
<br>

\subsection ssPSMEnablePSM Enable PSM Use on Front Panel.

<br>
\image html config-psm-enable-psm.png "Enable PSM Use"
\image latex config-psm-enable-psm.png "Enable PSM Use" width=5.5in
<br>

Selecting this checkbox enables the PSM button on FLDIGI's main window.
<br>

\subsection ssPSMPSMDefaults Resetting PSM to Defaults.

Pretty simple, just press the [ Defaults Settings ] button.
