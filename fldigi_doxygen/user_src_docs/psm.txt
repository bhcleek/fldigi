\section sDescription Description

PSM was originally introduced when the KISS IO interface was added and is
specifically designed for the unattended operator portion of the
Amateur Radio Bands; there are however other \ref sPossibleUse "possible uses".
<br>

\par NOTE:
PSM was originally called KPSQL and the name was change to better
differentiate it's function over the function of
\ref operating_controls_page "SQL".
<br>

To configure see \ref config_psm_page "Configure PSM".
<br>

\subsection ssCSMAUse CSMA Carrier Sense Multiple Access

  It's function is to monitor for signals within
the bandpass of the modem and place a TX inhibit anytime a signal was
present. This feature is reminiscent of the hardware TNC's during the
heydays of packet radio. Hardware TNC's with TNC2 firmware supported a
feature called CSMA. CSMA stands for <b>C</b>arrier <b>S</b>ense
<b>M</b>ultiple <b>A</b>ccess. CSMA would monitor for a signal and
inhibit transmit when a signal is present. But CSMA does more then just
monitor for signals it controls the aspect of how and when a transmit will
occur. To assist in the prevention of transmit collisions the transmit
schedule included a short random delay in the transmit process. Additionally
CSMA provided other parameters to control the frequency or how aggressive the
transmits are allowed and the duration of quite periods so other stations
have the opportunity to transmit. As you can tell this is designed to
allow multiple stations to cooperate on a single frequency. CSMA is not
exclusive to TNC's either in hardware or software. The communications
provided by your ISP using Ethernet is another example.
<br>

\subsection ssBusyChannelUse Busy Channel

Busy Channels is an extension to the CSMA methodology by incorporating
programming code to consider gaps in the transmission. This is either the
results of QSB or other broken/intermittent transmissions like the gaps
between RSID's and the data that follows. The side effect of this feature
is, it can be used to allow casual operators the use of a busy forward
and store BBS frequency. When enable the frequency would have to be clear
for the given set time before BBS operations would be allowed to continue.
<br>

\subsection ssHistgramUse Histogram

Histogram operation is pretty much experimentally at this stage. The basic
intent is to keep the detection threshold just above the noise level. In
doing so, the triggering of a transmit is highly aggressive, as far as
software is concerned. The actual aggressiveness is pretty slow when compared
to hardware detection used in TNC's. This option should only be used with FM
modulation and is not compatible with \ref ssBusyChannelUse.
<br>

\par WARNING Histogram: Experimental
You may not make many friends if you use this on FM AFSK packet frequencies.
The Author tested this on APRS frequencies and it fundamentally works. But
wasn't left on to instigate a riot.
<br>

\section sPossibleUse Possible Use(s)

As stated above it's primary designed for unattended operations. However,
it's reasonable to assume this might work during a digital net
operation when multiple stations are involved. Since PSM (KPSQL) has been
moved out of KISS IO interface, it's functionality is available to keyboard,
KISS, ARQ, and XMLRPC interfaces. This has the potential to cooperatively
transmit between multiple stations while using FLDIGI's suite of tools. Namely,
FLMSG, FLAMP, etc, and third party programs that makes using of the
aforementioned interfaces.
<br>

\section sPSMCharateristics PSM Characteristics

For those who have never used a CSMA device directly this may take a little
getting used to. Without PSM enabled you have direct control as to when the
transmit occurs. The human mind is pretty good at telling (by monitoring the
waterfall) when the best time to transmit is, far better then the current
implementation use in FLDIGI (detection wise). Patience is a PSM virtue, a
prerequisite for cooperative activities. Not to say operators don't have
this attribute, it's just PSM is more consistant in it's application.
<br>

With PSM enabled the operator can only instruct FLDIGI that transmit has been
requested. CSMA decides when the appropriate time to do so. How and when
CSMA transmits is dictated by adjustable parameters located on the PSM
configuration panel (\ref config_psm_page). Expect delays in the
transmitting of data. The amount of delay will vary with each TX/RX cycle.
<br>

Be mindfull of the adjustments made. The human nature side of this story
revolves around the impatient side of us. As an example during the packet
heydays (again) it's wasn't unusual for an operator to adjust CSMA parameters
to gain an unfair advantage and capitalize the limited bandwidth available
with our "slow" bitrate modems. You can not expect "high" throughput on a
frequency used by multiple operators. This doesn't even include the other
restrictions with limited bandwidth radio's and the rule of law.
<br>

The correct CSMA parameters other then the defaults for any given condition
is to varied, ie, number of users, band conditions, etc. Experimentation
is the only recourse. Dont be afraid of tweaking the values, just be mindful
of the outcome and it's effect on the other operators using the frequency.
<br>

\section sPSMAdustment Adjustment of PSM Threshold and Options

In order to adjust PSM theshold enable the following:
<br>

1. From the PSM configuration panel. Enable "Show and enable Power Signal
Monitor button (PSM)" checkbox.
<br>

2. Enable PSM button located in the lower right hand side of FLDIGI's main
window.
<br>

When PSM button is enabled on FLDIGI's main window. The Signal Level indicator
and SQL threshold slider are now active for PSM. A green box on the PSM
button indicates an active transmit inhibit. A yellow box indicates the
possibility of a transmit. Transmit may or may not occur depending on the
set parameters located on the PSM configuration panel.
<br>

Moving the SQL slider up changes the internal threshold reference, requiring
a higher signal level to trigger a detection that will inhibit transmit.
Setting the SQL slider lower allows a weaker signal to inhibit transmit,
which if set to low, means that inhibit may be triggered by the base noise
level. To determine where detection/non-detection threshold resides monitor
the PSM button's square colored indicator. When this boundary is reached
the color will toggle between green and yellow. It's easier to determine
the theshold point when Busy Channel is disabled.
<br>

When Busy Channel is enabled and set to 3 seconds (for example) each time
the signal crosses the set threshold of the SQL slider position a 3 second
transmit inhibit is activated. If a signal crossing the threshold occurs
again while inhibit is active the internal timer is reset to 3 seconds and
the inhibit continues until the timer expires or reset again by another
signal. This ensures there will be a 3 second period of "silence" before
the transmitter is allowed to transmit.
<br>

Enabling CSMA adds a randomness to the transmit event and is controlled by the
Persistance parameter. The values for Persistance ranges from 0-255 which is
translated to a percent value as seen on the PSM configuration panel. When set
to "63" this equates to a 25% chance of transmitting each time a random number
is generated and compared to the persistance value. Higher values results in
the greater likelihood transmit will occur. Slot Time is the no transmit period
between tranmissions and is measure in milliseconds. Transmit data delay is
used to send idle data before the relavent information is sent. This feature
is only available if the modem selected has an idle transmit state.
<br>

\par NOTE:
Deselecting PSM either by the configuration panal or by the PSM button provided
on FLDIGI's main window returns the SQL slider and signal level indicator back
to the SQL function. This enables the user to make SQL threshold adjustment to
inhibit character quality receptions.
