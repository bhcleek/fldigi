\section sConfigIO I/O Configuration

I/O configuration panel as seen above allows the user to select one of the IO
interfaces.  Each of the two interface options are used for different
purpose(s). ARQ is selected when the user requires the use of the
FLDIGI suite of programs (FLARQ, FLMSG, FLAMP, etc). The KISS interface
is used to tranfers 8 bit binary data over wireless pathways using HDLC encoded
frames.  With this interconnectivity multiple host programs are available to
leverage this option. See
\ref kiss_host_prgs_page "KISS Host Program(s) and FLDIGI"


\par Note:
Any changes to the IP Address and/or port numbers requires FLDIGI restart.

\subsection ssArqIO ARQ I/O

<br>
\image html config-io-arq.png "ARQ IO Panel Options"

<br>

To select ARQ I/O, mouse click on the [ ] Enable ARQ check box. If the
checkbox is grayed out, this indicated the panel is locked. Deselect the
[ ] Lock checkbox to gain access.

The ARQ section of the configuration panel allow the user to set the
IP address and port number.  Pressing the [Default] button set the fields
to their startup values. In order for communications to occur both FLDIGI
and the FLDIGI suite of program must be assign the same IP address and port
number if the programs are used on the same computer. If the program are
running on different machines then the IP Address must be set accordingly
while maintaining the same port number. The IP Address entered is the
destination Address for the recipiente program/host computer.

\subsection ssKissIO KISS I/O

To select KISS I/O, mouse click on the [ ] Enable KISS check box.

Setting and configuring IP address and ports numbers are described in the ARQ
section.

\subsection ssAx25Decode Ax25 Decoding

If the data received is using Ax25 protocol enabling this option translates
the protocol into human readable form. Only available when KISS I/O selected.

\par NOTE:
	When actived, only valid ax25 data will be displayed to the receive
	panel. No un-squelched random characters will be seen.

\subsection ssKISS KISS over IP

FLDIGI supports KISS data tranfers over two types of IP communications.
UDP (connectionles) and TCP (connection). Each method have is avantages
and disavantages.  If you wish to know more about the differences performing
a search on the internet using key words:

"TCP/IP UDP/IP"

If you are a programmer a good source and free documentation on the subject
can be found by performing a search on these keywords:

"Beej's Guide to Network Programming"

\subsubsection ssUDPIP Connectionless UDP/IP [UDP]

Selecting UDP/IP envoks a connectionless communications path. Host software
must support UDP/IP data transfers in order to use this option.

\subsubsection ssDualPort Dual Port [DP]

Used with UDP/IP communications and does not functions with TCP/IP
connections.

Since the data exchange protocol is based on UDP/IP (connectionless) a
loopback issue can arise if the two programs are hosted on the same machine.
By allowing more then one port number the loopback condition can be avoided.
Host programs must support dual port for proper communications.

\subsubsection ssTCPIP Connection TCP/IP [TCP]

TCP connections are far more reliable then UDP since the protocol confirms data
transfers between programs.  UDP communications on the same machine is
generally a non issue though. It's normally an issues when distance and
congestion comes into play as packet might timeout in the transfer process.
TCP/IP can resend the data where UDP doesn't.

Select TCP/IP if the host program supports it.

\subsubsection ssLISTEN_BIND Listen/Bind

When selected (checked) with TCP/IP the interface will wait/listen for TCP/IP
connections from the host program. If unchecked the user will press the start
button and FLDIGI will attempt to connect to the host program multiple time
over a ten second period.

If the connection fails the user should ensure the FLDIGI/host program is
running and configured correctly.

The Binding is a operating system process for a given IP address and port
number. The binding of an address/port number can only occur once on the same
machine no matter how many programs use the same address and port number. If
you are getting errors as a results of binding it's possible another program
on the same machine has bound the address/port number already. Unchecking this
option may help in this circumstance.  Listen/Bind is required if you want
FLDIGI to wait for connections.

To start the Listening state pressing the start button is required. In the
event the host programs disconnects FLDIGI will return to Listen state unless
the user selects the Stop button. The Start and Stop button is the same button
that is renamed depending the connection state.

\subsubsection ssAutoConnect Auto Connect [AC]

Auto connect is used to connect to the host program on start up. Configure
KISS interface as needed then enable (check) the [x] AC option. Press the
[Save] button at the botton of the configuration panel in order for it to
take effect on the next restart. This is a useful option in the event of
power failures.

\subsubsection ssInhibit7bit Inhibit 7bit Modem

Selecting this option will disable the warning message reported by FLDIGI
in the event there is a change to a modem type that is not KISS IO compatible.
The invalid modem will be ignored and FLDIGI will remain in the current valid
modem.  Deselecting this option allows the operator to approve the modem
change.

This is an option that should be disabled when FLDIGI is used in an automated
state as FLDIGI will wait indefinitely for a response from the operator.
